A sample command-line application for use with [Docs.page](https://docs.page). Entrypoint in `bin/`, library code
in `lib/`.

Currently in prelease.

Supports two commands. `docs_page init` initializes a directory as a `Docs.page` project, and `docs_page typedoc` generates documentation compatible with `Docs.page` from
a typedoc.json file in a `docs` subdirectory. See [use.docs.page](https://use.docs.page) for more information about `Docs.page`.
