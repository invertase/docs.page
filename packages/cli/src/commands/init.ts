Welcome to docs.page! The init command you just ran has created a basic file struture in your project to help you get started.

## Walkthrough

### Configuration

In the root of your directory a new \`docs.json\` file has been created. This file is used to configure your documentation site. You can customize the name, description, and sidebar, theme, logos and more using this file.

Here's a basic example of what the file looks like:

\`\`\`
${jsonConfiguration({ sidebar: true })}
\`\`\`

To learn more about the advanced configuration options, check out the [docs](https://use.docs.page/configuration).

### Content

docs.page uses the \`docs\` directory to store your documentation pages. Two pages have been created for you:

- \`index.mdx\` - The home page of your documentation site, resolves to the root URL.
- \`next-steps.mdx\` - A page to help you get started with docs.page, resolves to \`/next-steps\`.

Documentation can be written using the standard [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/) and also supports the use of [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), 
with the ability to render custom [components](https://use.docs.page/components) for more advanced use cases.

## Preview

To preview your documentation site, head over to [https://docs.page/preview](https://docs.page/preview) in your browser and open this directory.

Previewing your documentation site will allow you to see the changes you make in real-time before you publish to the world.
