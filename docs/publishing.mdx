Once you've finished writing your documentation, you'll want to expose it to the world. Just like conventional development using GitHub, this is done via version control.

## Publishing to GitHub

When ready, commit your documentation changes to your repository using Git, and push the changes, for example:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new documentation"
git push origin main
```

Once complete, your documentation will immediatley available on the docs.page domain. For example, if your GitHub repository is `acme/my-repository`, your documentation will be available at `https://docs.page/acme/my-repository`.

docs.page uses the base branch of your repository to determine which version of your documentation to display (in most cases, this is either `main` or `master`). Pushing new changes to this branch will automatically update your documentation.

## Publishing changes

Just like your development experience, you may want to push new documentation changes to a different branch before merging them into your main branch. This can be done by pushing to a different branch, for example:

```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
git add .
git commit -m "Add docs for new feature"
git push origin new-feature
```

Once pushed, you can preview your changes by visiting `https://docs.page/acme/my-repository~new-feature`. Once you're happy with the changes, you can merge the branch into your main branch.
