# Custom Components

Those familar with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) may be familiar with the concept of custom components.
With MDX, you can create your own components and use them in your markdown files.

<Warning>
  Currently, custom components only work per-page. There is no way to share them across multiple
  page. We're looking into ways to achieve this.
</Warning>

## Creating a custom component

Somewhere in your MDX file, add an export which returns a JSX component. For example:

```jsx
export const BoldText = props => {
  return <span style={{ color: props.color, fontWeight: 'bold' }}>{props.children}</span>;
};
```

Now within that page, use the component where you like:

```mdx
Hello there, this is some <BoldText color="red">bold red text</BoldText>!
```

## Using components

Components have some advantages and disadvantages you can note below.

- <Icon name="check" /> Component children also supports other components.
- <Icon name="check" /> You can pass props (including other components) to the component.
- <Icon name="check" /> You can provide custom CSS styles (in object format).

- <Icon name="xmark" /> You cannot share components across pages.
- <Icon name="xmark" /> You cannot use custom Tailwind class names (since they are not bundled).

## Applying your Theme

You can apply custom classes to elements to style them with your theme. For example:

```jsx
export const ThemedText = props => {
  return <span class="text-docs-theme">{props.children}</span>;
};
```

Class names follow the Tailwind naming convention, so you can apply the theme to various properties, such as:

| Property   | Class Name        |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| background | bg-docs-theme     |
| color      | text-docs-theme   |
| border     | border-docs-theme |
