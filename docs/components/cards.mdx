To display a card, use the `Card` component. You can also use the `CardGroup` component to display multiple cards in a row.

````jsx
<Card title="Installation" icon="cog">
  Install this package using npm or yarn.

  ```bash
  npm install @myorg/my-package
  ```
</Card>
````

<Card title="Installation" icon="cog">
  Install this package using npm or yarn.

  ```bash
  npm install @myorg/my-package
  ```
</Card>

Optionally, add a `href` prop to the `Card` component to make the card clickable.

````jsx
<Card title="Learn more" icon="school" href="/">
  Click here to learn more about this package.
</Card>
````

<Card title="Learn more" icon="school" href="/">
  Click here to learn more about this package.
</Card>

## Groups

To group cards into columns, use the `CardGroup` component.

````jsx
<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Installation" icon="cog">
    Install this package using npm or yarn.

    ```bash
    npm install @myorg/my-package
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="Learn more" icon="school" href="/">
    Click here to learn more about this package.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
````

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Installation" icon="1">
    Install this package using npm or yarn.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Documentation" icon="2">
    Read the documentation.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

You can customize the number of columns by setting the `cols` prop.
