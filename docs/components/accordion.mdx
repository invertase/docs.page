# Accordion

An accordion can be used to render collapsible content, useful for information which might not
be relevant to all users.

## Usage

Use the `<Accordion>` component to render an accordion, providing a `title` property.

```jsx
<Accordion title="Click me to expand the accordion">This is collapsible content!</Accordion>
```

<Accordion title="Click me to expand the accordion">This is collapsible content!</Accordion>

### Default value

Pass the `defaultOpen` prop to have the accordion open by default.

```jsx
<Accordion defaultOpen title="Open by default">
  This is collapsible content!
</Accordion>
```

<Accordion defaultOpen title="Open by default">
  This is collapsible content!
</Accordion>
