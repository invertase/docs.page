An accordion can be used to render collapsible content, useful for information which might not
be relevant to all users.

## Usage

Use the `<Accordion>` component to render an accordion, providing a `title` property.

```jsx
<Accordion title="Click me to expand the accordion">This is collapsible content!</Accordion>
```

<Accordion title="Click me to expand the accordion">This is collapsible content!</Accordion>

### Default value

Pass the `defaultOpen` prop to have the accordion open by default.

```jsx
<Accordion defaultOpen title="Open by default">
  This is collapsible content!
</Accordion>
```

<Accordion defaultOpen title="Open by default">
  This is collapsible content!
</Accordion>

### Icons

Use the `icon` prop to specify an icon to display next to the accordion title.

```jsx
<Accordion icon="info" title="Click me to expand the accordion">
  This is collapsible content!
</Accordion>
```

<Accordion icon="circle-info" title="Click me to expand the accordion">
  This is collapsible content!
</Accordion>

## Groups

To group accordions into a single display unit, use the `<AccordionGroup>` component, with each
`<Accordion>` component as a child.

```jsx
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion defaultOpen title="Open by default">
    This is collapsible content!
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Click me to expand the accordion">
    This is collapsible content!
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion defaultOpen title="Open by default">
    This is collapsible content!
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Click me to expand the accordion">
    This is collapsible content!
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
