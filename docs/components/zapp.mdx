# Zapp!

[Zapp!](https://zapp.run) is a free online Dart & Flutter sandbox that lets you run Dart code in the browser. It's great for sharing code snippets in your documentation.

## Embedding Zapp!

Use the `<Zapp>` component and pass the ID of the Zapp! you want to embed.

```jsx
<Zapp id="flutter" />
```

<Zapp id="flutter" />

## Lazy Loading

To prevent the sandbox from loading until the user interacts, pass the `lazy` prop.

```jsx
<Zapp lazy id="flutter" />
```

<Zapp lazy id="flutter" />
