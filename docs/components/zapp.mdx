# Zapp!

[Zapp!](https://zapp.run) is a free online Dart & Flutter sandbox that lets you run Dart code in the browser. It's great for sharing code snippets in your documentation.

## Embedding Zapp!

Use the `<Zapp>` component and pass the ID of the Zapp! you want to embed.

```jsx
<Zapp id="flutter" />
```

<Zapp id="flutter" />

## Lazy Loading

To prevent the sandbox from loading until the user interacts, pass the `lazy` prop.

```jsx
<Zapp lazy id="flutter" />
```

<Zapp lazy id="flutter" />

## From GitHub

To load a Zapp! from GitHub, set the `id` prop to `github/<path>`.

```jsx
<Zapp id="github/roaa94/flutter_3d_calculator" />
```

<Zapp id="github/roaa94/flutter_3d_calculator" />

You can also pass a path relative to the root of the repository.

```jsx
<Zapp id="github/rrousselGit/riverpod/tree/master/packages/flutter_riverpod/example" />
```

<Zapp id="github/rrousselGit/riverpod/tree/master/packages/flutter_riverpod/example" />

## From GitHub Gists

To load a Zapp! from a GitHub Gist, set the `id` prop to `gist/<id>`.

Gist: 
https://gist.github.com/flutterdevrelgists/ecabed4a17a3aad8bee7c6327e472fc8

Zapp:
```jsx
<Zapp id="gist/ecabed4a17a3aad8bee7c6327e472fc8" />
```

Final product:
<Zapp id="gist/ecabed4a17a3aad8bee7c6327e472fc8" />

## From Pub

To load a Zapp! from a https://pub.dev example, set the `id` prop to `pub/<package>` or `pub/<package>/<version>`.

```jsx
<Zapp id="pub/http" />

<Zapp id="pub/http/0.13.4" />
```

<Zapp id="pub/http" />

<Zapp id="pub/http/0.13.4" />
