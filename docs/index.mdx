docs.page is a free Open Source project, allowing you to create instant, fast, beautiful documentation with zero configuration.

Documentation is an important aspect for many projects, however creating a custom documentation website
for each project is time consuming. Many common solutions to problems have to be duplicated, along with
dealing with overheads such as website maintenance & hosting.

Solutions such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/),
[docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) and many others are great projects, however still require custom setup for each project
and regular maintenance.

docs.page is designed to deliver instant documentation websites, with the content sourced directly from any public
GitHub repository. Features include:

- [Configurable](/configuration): Add your own logo, theme, analytics, navigation and more with a simple config file.
- [Previewing](/previews): View the documentation of any branch, pull request or specific commit,.
- [GitHub Bot](/github-bot): Install our [GitHub bot](https://github.com/apps/docs-page) to automatically get a URL to pull request documentation previews.
- [Components](/components): Powered by [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx), use React components such as Tabs (useful for projects with multiple languages) directly in your docs.
- [Search](/search): Easily add full search support powered by [DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/).
- [Custom Domains](/custom-domains): Serve your documentation using your own domain.

Other useful features include:

- Global variable injection (for managing common variables across the project).
- Displaying assets using GitHub.
- Dark/Light mode.
- Responsive.
- Code block highlighting and content copying.
- Page redirects.
- Per-page metadata support via Frontmatter.

docs.page is a simple way to generate a documentation website with zero effort. It generally works for documentation websites with a lot of Markdown based content.
If you require features which are more specific to your own project a custom solution might work better.
