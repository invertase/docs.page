title: Live Previews
description: View previews of upcoming changes to your documentation.

As your project evolves, you'll want to preview changes before they go live, whether those changes are from your team or an external contributor. 

Each reference on your GitHub repository, whether that be a branch, commit or pull-request can be live previewed.

<Info>
  Consider installing our [GitHub App](/github-bot) on your project to get comments on your Pull Requests with the unique live preview URL.
</Info>

## Unique URLs

To preview a reference, append it to the end of the base `docs.page` URL for your repository. For example, assuming there's a branch called `next`, we can
immidiately preview it by visiting `https://docs.page/:owner/:repository~next`.

This method works for branches, commits and pull-requests:

```
# Branch (next)
https://docs.page/:owner/:repository~next

# Commit (f3e0074efe4a131edf75e8960123d221b6f40949)
https://docs.page/:owner/:repository~f3e0074efe4a131edf75e8960123d221b6f40949

# Pull Request (13)
https://docs.page/:owner/:repository~13
```

## Custom Domains

If you have configured a [Custom Domain](/custom-domains) for your documentation, The first part of the URL will be your custom domain:


```
# Branch (next)
https://docs.example.com/~next

# Commit (f3e0074efe4a131edf75e8960123d221b6f40949)
https://docs.example.com/~f3e0074efe4a131edf75e8960123d221b6f40949

# Pull Request (13)
https://docs.example.com/~13
```

## Encoding

If a reference (such as a branch) contains a special character (such as a forward slash), the reference should be URL encoded
to ensure the reference doesn't conflict with the URL. For example with a branch named "@team/next":

```txt
https://docs.page/invertase/melos~%40team%2Fnext

# Custom domain
https://melos.invertase.dev/~%40team%2Fnext
```
