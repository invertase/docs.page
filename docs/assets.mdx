Assets such as images and videos are a common requirement for documentation.

## Remote Assets

To use remote assets in your documentation, you can reference them directly in your markdown files.

For example, to include an image from a URL:

```md
![Description](https://example.com/image.png)
```

## Local Assets

To use assets with your documentation, you can add them to your repository within the `docs/` directory and reference them in your markdown files.

For example, consider the following directory structure:

```
docs/
  assets/
    image.png
  index.mdx
```

Within your markdown file, you can reference the image using a relative path:

```md
![Description](/assets/image.png)
```

<Info>
  You can place assets where you wish - whether in a root `docs/assets` directory or co-located next to your markdown.
