# docs.page

docs.page is a free Open Source project, allowing you to create instant, fast, beautiful documentation with zero configuration.

Documentation is an important aspect for many projects, however creating a custom documentation website
for each project is time consuming. Many common solutions to problems have to be duplicated, along with 
dealing with overheads such as website maintenance & hosting.

Solutions such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/),
[docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) and many others are great projects, however still require custom setup for each project.

This project delivers instant documentation websites with the content sourced directly from any public
GitHub repository. Features include:

- Branch & Pull Request previewing.
- GitHub Pull Request bot for previewing automation.
- Dark / Light mode theme support.
- [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) components such as Tabs (useful for projects with multiple languages).
- Server Side Rendered (SSR) pages (powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) & [Vervel](https://vercel.com)).
- Support for search via [Docsearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/).
- Managing common project variables.
- Many [configurable](https://docs.page/invertase/docs.page/configuration) options, such as sidebars, Google Analytics, theming and more.

## Should I use docs.page?

docs.page is a simple way to generate a documentation website with zero effort. It generally works for documentation websites with a lot of Markdown based content. If you require features which are more specific to your own project a custom solution might work better.
