docs.page allows you to preview any repository reference, such as a branch, pull request or specific commit.

> Use the [GitHub bot](/github-bot) to automatically comment on pull requests with the preview URL!

All preview URLs are not indexable by search engine bots.

## Default domain

When using the default `docs.page` domain, append the reference to the repository section of the URL using the `~` character,
for example:

```txt
// Branch ("next")
https://docs.page/invertase/melos~next

// Pull Request (#48)
https://docs.page/invertase/melos~48

// Commit (SHA256)
https://docs.page/invertase/melos~4114ba8fc3c0d7d88ff81ef24fb8c4b5a5c27874
```

## Custom Domain

When using a custom domain (e.g. https://melos.invertase.dev), provide the reference
as the first URL path prefixed with the `~` character, for example:

```txt
// Branch ("next")
https://melos.invertase.dev/~next

// Pull Request (#48)
https://melos.invertase.dev/~48

// Commit (SHA256)
https://melos.invertase.dev/~4114ba8fc3c0d7d88ff81ef24fb8c4b5a5c27874
```

## Encoding

If a reference (such as a branch) contains a special character (such as a forward slash), the reference should be URL encoded
to ensure the reference doesn't conflict with the URL. For example with a branch named "@team/next":

```txt
// Default domain
https://docs.page/invertase/melos~%40team%2Fnext

https://melos.invertase.dev/~%40team%2Fnext
```

## Local Preview Mode

docs.page now also supports previewing docs on your local machine, with a hot reload feature.

No local software installations are required. All you need is a directory on your machine with at least a `docs` subdirectory, and a file `docs/index.mdx` as usual.

Then navigate to [docs.page/preview](https://docs.page/preview) and select this directory, allow permissions and docs.page should do the rest!
