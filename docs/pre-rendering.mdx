# Pre-rendering

By default pages are not pre-rendered, meaning in a couple of scenarios you may see a loading page or experience a slight delay
whilst navigating to a page from within an existing page. These scenarios are:

- The first time a page is requested
- After a new deployment of docs.page (since pre-rendered pages are deleted)

Once a page has been requested, any subsequent requests will serve a pre-rendered version of the page instantly. Pages are
invalidated every 30 seconds, however users will still be served the invalidated pre-rendered page until the new version has
been built.

To learn more about this, visit the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#pre-rendering).
