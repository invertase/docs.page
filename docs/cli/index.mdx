The docs.page CLI is a command-line interface for interacting with docs.page. It allows you to initialize a new project and check for issues with your documentation,
such as broken links.

The CLI is published as an NPM package and can be installed globally using the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @docs.page/cli
```

Alternatively, you can use `npx` to run the CLI without installing it globally:

```bash
npx @docs.page/cli
```

## Commands

- [`init`](/cli/init): Initialize a new project.
- [`check`](/cli/check): Check for issues with your documentation.
