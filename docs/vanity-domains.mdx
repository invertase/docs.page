With zero additional configuration required, docs.page supports vanity domains which enable to give your GitHub organization/username a unique identity on the internet for
your documentation.

For example, if your GitHub organization is `invertase` and you have multiple repositories with documentation (e.g. `melos` & `docs.page`), you can immediately access your documentation at
 `https://invertase.docs.page/melos` and `https://invertase.docs.page/docs.page`.
