description: Install our GitHub bot on repositories using docs.page

When pull requests are made to your repository, being able to visually view how changes within the pull request
impact your documentation is extremely valuable. The docs.page GitHub bot comments on new pull requests
with a dedicated URL allowing anyone to view the documentation for the specific pull request.

To get started, visit the [GitHub page](https://github.com/apps/docs-page) and install the application on
any repository using docs.page.

If you have a [Custom Domain](/custom-domains) configured, the bot will display a URL using the custom domain
rather than the default `docs.page` domain.
