# Writing Content

docs.page supports writing Markdown in the [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/) (GitHub Flavored Markdown) format. This means you can write your
content in a familiar format and it will be rendered as HTML.

Alongside this, you may notice the file extension for your content is `.mdx` (instead of `.md`). This is because docs.page supports [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/),
which allows you to write JSX inside your Markdown files. This means you can write JSX components inside your Markdown files too!
