Frontmatter is a way to customize metadata of a page directly within your Markdown files. The metadata properties can
be added to Markdown pages by adding frontmatter blocks to the top of any page.

```text title=Example Frontmatter
---
title: Welcome to Awesome Project
description: Some awesome docs!
---

# Welcome!
```

Frontmatter overrides any default properties set in the [project configuration file](/configuration). This allows you to customize each page with unique metadata.
