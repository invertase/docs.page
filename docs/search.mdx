description: Add powerful documentation search using DocSearch
---

# Search

docs.page uses [DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) by Algolia to provide full, in-depth rich search
to your documentation for free.

## Join the program

To get started, [join the DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/apply/) program by providing the URL to your
documentation and email address.

## Configuration

Once accepted, you will be provided with an API Key and Index Name used to connect to the DocSearch service.

Within your project configuration file, add these credentials to the `docsearch` object:

```json
{
  "docsearch": {
    "appId": "...",
    "apiKey": "...",
    "indexName": "..."
  }
}
```

Once committed, a search bar will appear in the header of the documentation with the search connected.
