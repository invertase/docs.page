description: Add powerful documentation search using DocSearch
---

# Search

docs.page uses [DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) by Algolia to provide full, in-depth rich search
to your documentation for free.

## Join the program

To get started, [join the DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/apply/) program by providing the URL to your
documentation and email address.

## Configuration

Once accepted, you will be provided with an API Key and Index Name used to connect to the DocSearch service.

Within your projects `docs.json` configuration file, add these credentials to the `search` object:

```json title="docs.json"
{
  "search": {
    "apiKey": "...",
    "indexName": "..."
  }
}
```

Once committed, a search bar will appear in the header of the documentation with the search connected.

You can also optionally provide your Application ID via the `appId` property to enable pre-connection to help speed up
the initial search query for users with slower connections.
