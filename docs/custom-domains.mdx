Custom domain support allows you to serve your documentation content through any domain (or subdomain)
you own rather than via the `https://docs.page` domain.

You can see a custom domain in action by viewing the [Melos repository documentation](https://melos.invertase.dev), using
the `melos.invertase.dev` subdomain.

## Setup

A couple of manual steps are required before you can serve docs via your custom domain.

### 1. Domain DNS

The first step is to point your domain at our domains service via a `CNAME` record. Using your domain provider,
create a DNS record:

| invertase.dev | record type |       value       |
| :-----------: | :---------: | :---------------: |
|       @       |    CNAME    | domains.docs.page |

Subdomains are also supported:

| invertase.dev | record type |       value       |
| :-----------: | :---------: | :---------------: |
|     melos     |    CNAME    | domains.docs.page |

If you are using a proxy service (e.g., Cloudflare), ensure you disable the proxy to allow the `docs.page`
proxy service to provide SSL for you.

### 2. Add domain

Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/invertase/docs.page/edit/main/domains.json) to modify the [`domains.json`](https://github.com/invertase/docs.page/blob/master/domains.json)
file at the root of the `docs.page` repository.

Create a new array entry, adding your domain followed by the GitHub organization and repository, for example:

```json
[["melos.invertase.dev", "invertase/melos"]]
```

Once your Pull Request is approved and DNS has been propagated, you are ready to start using your custom domain.

## Existing documentation

If your users have already been visiting your documentation via the `docs.page` domain, (e.g. https://docs.page/invertase/melos) and
you add a custom domain at a later date, visitors will still be able to view the documentation, however all internal page links
will point towards the new domain.

This ensures adding a domain has no impact on users visiting saved URLs.
