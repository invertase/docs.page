# Typedoc Support

If you've added typedoc-compliant comments to your code, Docs.page is able to generate reference pages from your typedoc.json.

The steps are as follows:

1. In your root directory, generate your `typedoc.json` from your code, using the flag `--json`, and specifying your output path as `docs/typedoc.json`. You will have to install typedoc first, and the command should look similar to:

```
npm run typedoc --json docs/typedoc.json src/index.ts
```

or if you're using yarn,

```
yarn typedoc --json docs/typedoc.json src/index.ts
```

2. Add a `references` field to your `docs.json` or `docs.yaml` configuration file. This value specifies the folder in which your references will be generated. If you're unsure, set it as `Reference` or `API`.
3. Add a `typedocEntryDir` field to your `docs.json` or `docs.yaml` configuration file. This should be set as the path of the directory where your typedoc entry file is.
4. Run
   `docs_page typedoc`
   from your root directory.
