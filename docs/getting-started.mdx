# Getting Started

The docs.page project reads files directly from your GitHub repository. To get started:

1. Create a `docs` directory to any **public** GitHub repository.
2. Create an `index.mdx` file.
3. Add some Markdown content.
4. View your documentation.

The documentation is available by providing the repositories owner and name after the domain:

```txt
// https://github.com/acme/awesome-project
https://docs.page/acme/awesome-project
```

## Using our CLI tool

To make setting up docs.page with your project as smooth and as seemless as possible, we've added a small CLI tool, `@docs.page/init` .

If you have `node` and `npm` installed locally you can `cd` to the root of your project and run the command

```
npx @docs.page/init
```

This will add a `docs.json`, a `docs` directory, and a couple of `mdx` files to get you started.

From there you can preview your documentation by visiting `docs.page/preview`, and selecting your root directory for preview.

Once you're happy with your documentation you can push changes to your Github repository and your documentation site will be ready to visit!

## Working with Markdown

The project supports rendering all [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

Under the hood, [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) is enabled which allows the use of [Custom Components](/components/accordion). Each Markdown
page also supports [Frontmatter](/frontmatter), allowing you to customize the metadata of each specific page.

## Configuring your documentation

By default, docs.page will render a single page with default configuration options. Although there is nothing wrong with this, you can
further enhance the functionality of the generated documentation by creating a `docs.json` file at the root of your repository:

```json title=docs.json
{
  "name": "Awesome Project",
  "theme": "#ab47bc",
  "favicon": "/assets/favicon.ico",
  "logo": "https://mycdn.com/awesome-logo.png",
  "docsearch": {
    "appId": "...",
    "apiKey": "...",
    "indexName": "..."
  }
}
```

Once committed, docs.page will first read the configuration and update the website. To learn more about the
available configuration options, view the [documentation](/configuration).
