# Getting Started

The docs.page project reads files directly from your GitHub repository. To get started:

1. Add a `docs` directory to any **public** GitHub repository.
2. Create an `index.md` file.
3. Add some Markdown content.
4. View your documentation.

The documentation is available by providing the repositories owner and name after the domain:

```
// https://github.com/acme/awesome-project
https://docs.page/acme/awesome-project
```

## Working with Markdown

The project supports rendering all [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

Under the hood, [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) is enabled which allows the use of [Custom Components](/components). Each Markdown
page also supports [Frontmatter](/frontmatter), allowing you to customize the metadata of each specific page.

## Configuring your documentation

By default, docs.page will render a single page with default configuration options. Although there is nothing wrong with this, you can
further enhance the functionality of the generated documentation by creating a `docs.json` file at the root of your repository:

```json title=docs.json
{
  "name": "Awesome Project",
  "theme": "#ab47bc",
  "logo": "https://mycdn.com/awesome-logo.png",
  "docsearch": {
    "appId": "...",
    "apiKey": "...",
    "indexName": "..."
  }
}
```

Once committed, docs.page will first read the configuration and update the website. To learn more about the
available configuration options, view the [documentation](configuration).
