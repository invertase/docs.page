description: Learn how to start publishing documentation with docs.page.
---

docs.page reads files directly from your GitHub repository and uses them to generate a documentation website.
This guide will walk you through the steps to get started with docs.page.

There are two core principles to keep in mind when working with docs.page:

- Every project requires a `docs.json` file at the root of the project.
- All documentation files are stored in a `docs` directory as `.mdx` files.

## Quick Start

To get started, either use the CLI tool or manually create the required files.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="CLI" value="cli">
    Using `npx`, run the following command at the root of your project:

    ```bash
    npx @docs.page/cli init
    ```

    The CLI will create a few files in your current working directory:

    - `docs.json`
    - `docs/index.mdx`
    - `docs/usage.mdx`
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Manual" value="manual">
    At the root of your project, create a new `docs.json` file with the following content:

    ```json title="docs.json"
    {
      "name": "My Project",
      "description": "My awesome documentation."
    }
    ```

    Next, create a `docs` directory and add an `index.mdx` file with the following content:

    ```mdx title="docs/index.mdx"
    ---
    title: Hello docs.page
    ---

    # Welcome to docs.page
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Previewing your documentation

Now your project has the requires `docs.json` configuration file and a sample `docs/index.mdx` page, we can now preview our documentation.

Head on over to `https://docs.page/preview` and select your project directory when prompted. This will generate a preview of your documentation:

TODO: Image

You can made modifications to your configuration and documentation in realtime and see the changes reflected in the preview. For more information on local preview mode,
view the [Local Preview](/local-previewing) documentation.

## Updating your configuration

At present your documentation doesn't look too great, isn't very informative and probably doesn't feel like it belongs to your product or service. Let's fix that.

The `docs.json` file which has been created in your project root contains a number of configuration options which can be used to customize your documentation. The 
[Configuration](/configuration) documentation contains a full list of available configuration options. For example, let's change the theme color of our documentation
via the `theme` property:

```json title="docs.json"
{
  "theme": {
    "primary": "#ab47bc"
  }
}
```

We can also add a logo to our documentation by setting the `logo` property:

```json title="docs.json"
{
  "logo": {
    "light": "https://mycdn.com/awesome-logo.png",
    "dark": "https://mycdn.com/awesome-logo-dark.png"
  }
}
```

## Adding more documentation pages

Each `.mdx` file created inside of the `docs/` directory represents a new page in your documentation. You can create as many pages as you like, and even nest them inside of
subdirectories. For example, let's create a new `docs/usage.mdx` file:

```mdx title="docs/usage.mdx"
---
title: Usage
---

# How to use my project
```

When users vist the `/usage` page on your documentation site, they will see the content of this file. To create a nested page, you can create a subdirectory inside of the `docs/` directory, 
for example `docs/platforms/windows/index.mdx`:

```mdx title="docs/platforms/windows/index.mdx"
---
title: Windows Usage
---

# How to use my project on Windows
```

When users visit the `/platforms/windows` page on your documentation site, they will see the content of this file.

## Writing content

All of your documentation pages are written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), with the added ability to include useful visual components. 

Markdown is a simple markup syntax, which allows you to write plain text which is transformed into usable HTML elements, such as headings, images, links and lists. For example, to create a heading in markdown, you can use the `#` symbol:

```md
### This is a level 3 heading

This is some paragraph text which will be shown below the heading.
```

Additionally, docs.page exposes [components](/components) to allow you to include more complex elements in your documentation. For example, to add an accordion to your documentation, you can use the `Accordion` component:

```mdx
<Accordion>
  This is the content of the accordion which will be shown when the accordion is expanded.
</Accordion>
```

To learn more about writing your markdown content, view the [documentation](/writing-content).

## Publishing your documentation

Publishing documentation using docs.page is the same as publishing code via version control on GitHub. 

Documentation is accessible using the owner and repository name of your GitHub repository. For example, if your repository is available at `https://github.com/acme/my-project`,
your documentation will be available at `https://docs.page/acme/my-project`.

The 'default' branch of your repository (typically `main` or `master`) is used as the production branch for your documentation. When you push changes to this branch, your documentation will be updated automatically.

### Live Previews

Whenever you make changes to your repository, either code and/or documentation, the GitHub reference for the change (for example a branch or commit sha) can be used to view the documentation at that point in time.

For example, to view the documentation at a specific commit, you can use the following URL:

```
https://docs.page/acme/my-project~COMMIT_SHA
```

To view the documentation for a specific branch, you can use the following URL:

```
https://docs.page/acme/my-project~BRANCH_NAME
```
